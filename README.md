## Homepage built with mdbook 

- Read about how to configure an mdbook [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/tree/master/book-example/src/format).
- Read about how to deploy an mdbook to Github Pages using Github Actions [here](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-mdbook).
- Solarized Highlight.js themes come from [here](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/), but mdbook plays nicer
with css files defined in the repo.
- Solarized Ace themes come from [here](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/tree/master/src-min-noconflict) which has no dependencies,
but mdbook plays nicer with css files defined in the repo. Regular Ace found in cdns requires `require.js`.
